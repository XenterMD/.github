# Xenter, Inc.
## A patient and physician founded company
[Xenter, Inc.](https://xentermd.com) was founded by a team of experienced physicians and scientists, and a patient who is both a medical device inventor and entrepreneur. In 2017, Richard J. Linder, Founder, Chairman/CEO of Xenter, Inc. envisioned a new generation of medical device technology utilizing the principles of Physical Intelligence (PI). Rich proposed his ideas to some of the leading physician scientists in the world. These unique partners came together to develop new technologies and bring advanced medical interventions to underdeveloped countries and people who do not have access to advanced healthcare and the lifesaving procedures that are offered only in the most advanced hospitals.

The vast majority of the worldâ€™s population does not have access to medical centers that have advanced cardiac catheterization laboratories. According to the US Centers for Disease Control, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, surpassing all cancers combined. And, for those people fortunate to live within the reach of modern medical centers, the costs of healthcare and medical procedures have skyrocketed. The Founders of Xenter, Inc. are inspired by the principles of equal access to lifesaving medical procedures for every patient in every location, no matter how remote.
